# Moirai-JDA-Bot
Casual bot made with Core Java 8 and JDA library. 

Only viable for private use with tiny amount of servers.

- No database, data is stored in .bin file.
- No lavalink. (only lavaplayer)
- Created with purpose and during duration of learning basics of core java, git and JDA.
- This version is butchered and censored for public view.

Saved here as memento for my future self.
